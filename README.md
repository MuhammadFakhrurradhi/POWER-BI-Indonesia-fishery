# POWER-BI-Indonesia-fishery


Indonesia is considered a maritime country due to its vast coastline and numerous islands. Its location in Southeast Asia also makes it a strategic point of trade and commerce. In addition, Indonesia's economy heavily relies on its maritime resources such as fisheries, oil and gas, and tourism. Within this project, I dive into dataset to extract valuable insights to realm of Indonesian fisheries. 


The dataset for this project has been generously provided by "Sea Around Us," and it can be easily accessed and downloaded from the following link: [https://www.seaaroundus.org/data/#/eez/361?chart=catch-chart&dimension=taxon&measure=tonnage&limit=10&sciname]. This dataset serves as a foundation for our analysis, enabling us to uncover meaningful insights into Indonesia's fisheries landscape.
